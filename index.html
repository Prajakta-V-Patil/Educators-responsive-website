        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small" >Social Media – The power of Social media is massive if used correctly. People from the remote areas are nowadays actively engaged on the Social Networking sites. Promotions can be made to explain and share the importance of education, how it helps shape up one’s career and where can one take admission. Parents counseling – Parents who believe education as a burden or an added expense in the family, should be made to take counseling. Their opinions regarding a girlchild’s education and any other backward notions can be removed through this counseling sessions. They must be taught regarding why they should encourage and send their kids to schools. NGO – Education is quickly becoming a business for schools and colleges, which have made demand exceed the supply. Financial constraints have prevented many from pursuing schooling. Although our constitution guarantees free primary level education, not many efforts have been made to make it a reality. Fortunately, non-profit school has made providing education their primal goal. Students coming from financially difficult backgrounds can take admissions in those NGO schools.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small" >In a time where India as a country is looking to move forward, the education sector is pulling the nation back. The mindset of the people needs to change to have an evenly distributed literacy rate. Regional disparities in education can be curbed only when parents, government and the society is educated about its benefits. Tabbassum, Tarannum, and Rubina are some of the examples who have done something and are continuing to do so for the education sector of India. It’s time that we follow the footsteps of these girls and help in spreading education.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small" >Our benefits section will really dive into the details, but it’s important that we establish why knowledge sharing is so important before we get to all that! The act of sharing knowledge alone is great for building rapport and relationships, where people get that warm fuzzy feeling from either sharing their wisdom or picking up on the wisdom of others. But it’s more than that, fostering a knowledge-sharing culture allows you to tap into subject matter experts! Across the business, people will have built skills and best practices that are specific to your product and customer – when they share those experiences, they allow others to skip the trial and error phase and get right to productivity. And the more you encourage that behaviour, the more an organic learning culture builds throughout the team! This means all of this and the benefits we’ll dive into are happening day in and day out.</p>
